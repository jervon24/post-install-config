Roles are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. Each Role has a set of permissions that can be assigned to agents given that Role in association with a Department they have access to. In this lab, I logged into the admin panel of os Ticket to configure roles. As per the picture, I added an "administration" role. I also, added permissions to this role. The picture below shows some of the permissions which were added.

"Level II support" team was added. The settings were then configured.Teams allow you to pull Agents from different Departments and organize them to handle a specific issue or user via a Help Topic or Ticket Filter. This for the ticket to be resolve in a timely manner and with the best means possible.

SLA Plans or Service Level Agreements, are unlimited in osTicket. The purpose of the SLA Plan is to provide a length of time in which the help desk Administrator expects tickets to be closed. Three SLA plans were created; SEV A (critical tickets that needs to be resolve as soon as possible), SEV B ( tickets with high priority that has a longer grace period that SEV A), SEV C (issues that could wait longer to be solved).

Help topics allows for proper ticket assignment and prompted a response to solving those tickets. Three help topics were created in addition to the generated ones. They were also assigned a department. The image below shows an email created for the system administrator department  with a high priority and help topic assigned. Tickets can be automatically by emailing this address.
